Arrr, I canâ€™t believe ye survived me attack... again.
Aye, it were a mighty fine battle! Songs will be sung 'bout this fer ages!
Ye be sayin' that, but I be feelin' like a bilge rat. How 'bout we bury the hatchet 'n share some cake?
No, thank ye. I reckon I've had me fill of yer tricks. But it were a grand fight, matey.
